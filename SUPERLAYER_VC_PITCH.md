# 🚀 Superlayer VC Pitch - MrGamePlayer

## 750-Character Pitch

**MrGamePlayer is a gaming infrastructure and Web3 multiplayer gaming platform where skill meets blockchain rewards. We've built a multiplayer gaming ecosystem with 10 fully-functional games (Tetris, Chess, Snake, Pong, and more) where players compete for MGP tokens on Polygon. Unlike play-to-earn models that rely on token inflation, we've created a sustainable circular economy: players buy tokens to play, winners take 90% of the pot, and the platform's 10% commission funds growth. Our ERC20 token with buy/sell functionality ensures liquidity even at max supply. With deployed smart contracts, a working beta, and a proven tokenomics model, we're ready to scale. We're seeking $50K-$100K to accelerate user acquisition, expand to 20 games, and launch on mainnet. The gaming blockchain market is exploding—we're positioned to capture it. Join us in revolutionizing how gamers earn while playing.**
